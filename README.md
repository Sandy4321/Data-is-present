# *Data Is Present!* Open Workshops and Hackathons

## Enhanced Presentation of Data Using Reproducible Reports and Data Dashboards

Original data has become more accessible thanks to cultural and technological advances. On the internet, we can find innumerable data sets from sources such as scientific journals and repositories (e.g., [OSF](https://osf.io)), local and national governments (e.g., [London](https://data.london.gov.uk/), UK [[1](https://www.ukdataservice.ac.uk/), [2](https://data.gov.uk/)]), and non-governmental organisations (e.g., [data.world](https://data.world/datasets/ngo)). Often, these data may be presented in novel ways, by creating new tables or plots, or by integrating additional data. Free, open-source software has become a great companion for open data.

This project offers free workshops and coding meet-ups to learn and practise data presentation, across the UK. It is enabled by a [fellowship of the Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/about/fellows/pablo-bernabeu).

## Open Access Data

Data is increasingly a public good. Academics and non-academic researchers (scientists, governments, NGOs) nowadays share a lot of their data under citation-based licences (e.g., [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/), the UK [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/1/), etc.). This allows any analysts to access these raw data, perform the visualisations and analyses they like, and share these.

## Open Source Software

Programs such as [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) offer free, powerful resources for data processing, visualisation, and analysis. Experience in these programs is highly valued in data-intensive sectors of the job market.

## Activities

The **ultimate activities of this project are open data hackathons**. To facilitate access to this activity, introductory and intermediate workshops in R will be available for free. All activities will carried out in various cities of the UK.

### R Workshops

Four participatory, practical workshops drawing on multi-levelled, real examples will be offered. Common challenges will be flagged, and further resources provided. Every workshop will have a taught part and a hands-on part. The level of the taught content will be largely tailored to the audience, and the hands-on part will be individually adaptable thanks to easier and tougher tasks available.

Participants will acquire or hone experience with a suite of interrelated tools based on Docker and R. The three tools--R Markdown, data dashboards, and Binder environments--are all underlain by freeware, inexpensive applications, and reproducible workflows. The usefulness of these tools extends from academia to data science. 

*Prerequisites:* R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio (https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). 

*Recommended preparation:* Familiarity with the relevant links herein; your own data and R code on Github. 

1. **Introduction to R:** 

- Object-oriented programming
- Data structures
- Loading and writing data, in native and foreign formats
- Packages: field-specific examples and [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
- Functions
- Debugging
- Vast availability of free resources on the internet (e.g., from [RStudio](), [Glasgow University](), and [many more](https://twitter.com/nickgaspelin/status/1219699050741714944))
- Community ([RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/), [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), etc.): Using and contributing
- [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/)

2. **[R Markdown reports](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)** —  Set your input and output beautifully in stone. These reports may be enriched with website features (HTML/CSS), and published as websites, PDF, or Word. Moreover, by using R packages such as `pagedown`, `blogdown`, `bookdown`, `flexdashboard`, reports can be turned into blogs, books, and data dashboards. 

3. **Introduction to data dashboards** —  Web applications can be used to visualise data in detail through tables and plots. These all-reproducible dashboards are published as websites, and thus, they can include hyperlinks and downloadable files. Users need not program. Some of the R packages used are `knitr`, `reactable`, `ggplot`, `plotly`, `rmarkdown`, `flexdashboard`, and `shiny`. The aim is to look at different forms of dashboards ([Flexdashboard](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/) and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)), and the suitable platforms for online hosting (personal websites and RPubs, Binder, Shinyapps, and custom servers). A great thing: dashboards may be made very simple, but they also offer the possibility of infinite improvement by drawing on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

4. **Intermediate data dashboards and Binder environments (Docker images)** —  More advanced practice with each of the hosting possibilities (e.g., [Flexdashboard website](http://rpubs.com/pcbernabeu/Dutch-modality-exclusivity-norms), [Flexdashboard Shiny](https://pablobernabeu.shinyapps.io/Dutch-modality-exclusivity-norms/#section-table), [Shiny](https://pablobernabeu.shinyapps.io/ERP-waveform-visualization_CMS-experiment/)). Furthermore, we will learn how to use [Binder environments](https://mybinder.org/) to enhance public access to our code (e.g., by publishing an RStudio session on the internet), and to host a data dashboard on the internet. This is free [just for us](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/mybinder-org-cost-updates/2426)). We'll look at the [nuts and bolts of all this](https://github.com/binder-examples/r). Attendees may deploy their own Binder environments.

### Hackathons

These hackathons are half day meetings meetings in which participants will collaborate to create reproducible reports (e.g., R Markdown) or data dashboards (e.g., R Shiny) from any open access data they choose.

*Prerequisites:* Basic knowledge of dashboard development.

*Recommended preparation:* Familiarity with the relevant links herein; an idea about the data and analyses to be performed.

- **Data**: Academic or non-academic, open-access data from sources such as [OSF](https://osf.io), scientific journals, governments, international institutions, NGOs, etc. Inspired by the great [Reprohacks](https://reprohack.github.io/reprohack-hq/), content suggestions are encouraged. That is, if you'd like to have a data dashboard created for a certain, open-access data set, let us know, and the participants may want to take it on.

- **Purpose**: Extend the original presentation of the data. This may include the linking to additional data, new visualisations, etc.

- **Output**: The various output (e.g., data dashboards) will be (co-)authored by the participants who develop it. Time constraints notwithstanding, a lot of this output may be very enticing for further development, by the same participants or by anyone else. For this purpose, participants are encouraged to publish their code on **open access**, for instance on Github.
