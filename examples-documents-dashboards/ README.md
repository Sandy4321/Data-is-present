# Examples of reproducible documents and data dashboards

Some examples of what can be created after the [workshops](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Data-is-present/blob/master/README.md#r-workshops), or at the [datathons](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Data-is-present/blob/master/README.md#datathons-creating-reproducible-documents-and-dashboards), are available.

If you'd like to submit your own, please [post an issue](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Data-is-present/issues) or email p.bernabeu@lancaster.ac.uk.
