# Examples of reproducible documents and data dashboards

These are examples of the kinds of documents that can be created with the skills learnt at the [workshops](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Data-is-present/blob/master/README.md#r-workshops). The [datathons](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Data-is-present/blob/master/README.md#datathons-creating-reproducible-documents-and-dashboards) will put these skills into practice (participants welcome to either or both).

If you would like to submit your own, please [post an issue](https://github.com/pablobernabeu/Data-is-present/issues) or email p.bernabeu@lancaster.ac.uk.
